# substack automation

## Introduction
Substack is intentionally restrictive around automated publishing. While many platforms allow programmatic posting, Substack optimizes for **editorial intent and author presence**. As a result, headless browsers, drivers, and scripted submissions often fail—even when they work elsewhere.

**Substack automation** is a **policy-aware content operations toolkit** that helps you automate everything *around* publishing:
- draft generation and formatting,
- scheduling and reminders,
- approvals and revisions,
- asset management,
- audit logs and reproducibility.

The final publish action remains **human-initiated**.

---

## Why This Automation Matters
- Saves hours on prep without risking account blocks  
- Avoids brittle browser automation that breaks overnight  
- Creates repeatable editorial workflows  
- Adds accountability with approvals and logs  
- Scales newsletters safely as teams grow

## How It Works

| Stage | Operation | Safety Control |

## FAQs

**Q: Why does Substack block browser automation?**  
Publishing actions are tied to session state, editorial intent, and abuse prevention. Automated submissions often fail server-side validation.

**Q: Is there an official Substack posting API?**  
No public API exists for programmatic publishing. Manual publishing is required.

**Q: What’s the safest way to “automate” Substack?**  
Automate drafts, formatting, scheduling, reminders, and approvals—then publish manually.

**Q: Can this integrate with email or calendars?**  
Yes. The repo supports reminders and exports for external tools.
